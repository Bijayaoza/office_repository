while downloading each file there will be chaptcha so for breaking it used mine chaptcha code 
mine captcha solving code is
# from DrissionPage import ChromiumPage 
# from RecaptchaSolver import RecaptchaSolver
# import time

# while True:
#     driver = ChromiumPage()
#     recaptchaSolver = RecaptchaSolver(driver)

#     driver.get("https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")

#     t0 = time.time()
#     recaptchaSolver.solveCaptcha()
#     print(f"Time to solve the captcha: {time.time()-t0:.2f} seconds")

#     driver.ele("#recaptcha-demo-submit").click()

#     driver.close()

#     print("Waiting 5 minutes before rerunning...")
#     time.sleep(300)  # Sleep for 5 minutes


from DrissionPage import ChromiumPage 
from RecaptchaSolver import RecaptchaSolver
import time

while True:
    driver = ChromiumPage()
    recaptchaSolver = RecaptchaSolver(driver)
    
    try:
        driver.get("https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")
        
        t0 = time.time()
        recaptchaSolver.solveCaptcha()
        print(f"Time to solve the captcha: {time.time()-t0:.2f} seconds")
        
        driver.ele("#recaptcha-demo-submit").click()
        print("Form submitted successfully")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during captcha solving: {str(e)}")
        
    finally:
        driver.close()
        print("Waiting 5 minutes before next run...")
        # time.sleep(300)  # 300 seconds = 5 minutes
        time.sleep(60)  # 60 seconds = 1 minutes
